# Numerical-Methods-Toolkit

Welcome to the Numerical Methods Toolkit! This repository houses two essential numerical methods: the Bisection Method and the Newton-Raphson Method. These methods are fundamental tools in numerical analysis for solving equations and finding roots of functions.

## Bisection Method

The Bisection Method is a reliable numerical technique for finding roots of continuous functions. It operates by iteratively narrowing down the interval in which a root lies until a desired level of accuracy is achieved. With its simplicity and robustness, the Bisection Method is widely used in various computational tasks.

### Files

- **bisection_method.py**: This file contains the implementation of the Bisection Method algorithm along with any necessary helper functions.

## Newton-Raphson Method

The Newton-Raphson Method, also known as Newton's method, is another powerful numerical technique for finding roots of functions. Unlike the Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson utilizes the derivative of the function to iteratively refine an initial guess for the root. It often converges faster than the Bisection Method for sufficiently smooth functions but requires careful consideration of the initial guess.

### Files

- **newton_raphson_method.py**: This file contains the implementation of the Newton-Raphson Method algorithm along with any necessary helper functions.

## Usage

To utilize the functionality provided by these methods, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the respective method files (`bisection_method.py` or `newton_raphson_method.py`).
3. Incorporate the methods into your own Python code or use them directly by importing from these files.
4. Experiment with different functions and initial guesses to understand the behavior and performance of each method.
